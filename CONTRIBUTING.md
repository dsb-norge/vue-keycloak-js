## Important Notice from the Maintainers

This project began as a utility wrapper for `keycloak-js`, providing a simpler way to instantiate Keycloak in projects developed by [@dsb-norge](https://github.com/dsb-norge).
We are currently transitioning from RedHat SSO to Keycloak, allowing us to update the `keycloak-js` adapter to the latest version of keycloak.

However, we will soon be moving away from Keycloak as well. Consequently, the project will eventually become stale, as we will no longer be able to verify or test changes or updates.

Given the traction this project has gained in the OSS community, we want to clearly communicate the initial goals and the current state of maintenance to avoid any confusion.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
