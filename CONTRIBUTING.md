## Important notice about the state of this project from the maintainers

This project started at one time as a utility wrapper for keycloak.js as a simpler way to instantiate keycloak
in the projects developed by [@dsb-norge](https://github.com/dsb-norge) , and our usage is tied to whatever 
version of keycloak is supplied by RedHat SSO. This again means that later versions of keycloak will not be
available for testing by the maintainers, and thus will not likely be supported or implemented by this project.

Since this project has gained some traction out there in the OSS landscape, we feel like we are doing the community a disservice by
letting the project go stale without communicating clearly what the initial goals were, and the current state of maintenance.
