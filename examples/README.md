# vue-keycloak-js example

## Prerequisites

You must have a Keycloak server running somewhere, with the correct
setup, eg. `redirectUri`, `clientId`, `realm` etc.

Or you could run: `docker-compose up` in this directory and get a temporary working
keycloak instance. You need to register a new user on the initial login

## Run the example

1. `git clone https://github.com/dsb-norge/vue-keycloak-js.git`
2. `cd vue-keycloak-js/examples/hello-keycloak`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run serve`
